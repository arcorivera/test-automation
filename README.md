# OrangeHRM Selenium Test Automation

This project is a UI Automation Test using Python, Selenium WebDriver, and Pytest for the OrangeHRM Open Source Demo website.

## üí° Project Overview

This automation script covers:

- Login validation for OrangeHRM.
- Navigation to important modules (`PIM`, `Leave`, `Time`, `Recruitment`, `Performance`, `Directory`, `Claim`, `Buzz` ).
- Image validation using AI-assisted duplicate & broken image detection.
- Automated HTML Report generation.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation.
- **PyTest**: For running tests and managing test cases.
- **OpenAI API**: For AI-powered image analysis.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
- **Pillow**: For image handling and validation.
- **requests**: For making HTTP requests to retrieve images.
- **imagehash**: For detecting duplicate images using perceptual hashes.

## ‚ö° How to Run the Tests

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
   cd YOUR_REPOSITORY

2. Set Up the Environment
Install Python & Virtual Environment
Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can check this by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
python --version
Next, create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash
Copy
Edit
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
Install Required Packages
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the necessary dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the required Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

3. Set Up OpenAI API Key
In order to use AI-powered image validation, you'll need an OpenAI API key.

Go to OpenAI and sign up or log in to generate your API key.

Create a .env file in the project root directory and add your OpenAI API key as follows:

ini
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
Make sure to replace your-openai-api-key with your actual OpenAI API key.

‚ö° Running the Tests
Once everything is set up, you can run the automated UI tests with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest test_script.py
This will:

Run the Selenium WebDriver tests.

Include the AI image validation.

Generate an HTML report with results and AI insights.

üìù Report Generation
After the test run completes, an HTML report (test_report.html) will be generated. You can open this report in your browser to view:

Test Execution Details: Overview of the test steps and their status.

AI Image Validation Insights: Information on broken and duplicate images, along with AI insights.

‚ùó Troubleshooting
Missing API Key: If you encounter errors regarding the OpenAI API, ensure the .env file is correctly configured with a valid API key.

Internet Connectivity: The tests require an internet connection to fetch images and communicate with the OpenAI API.

Selenium WebDriver: Ensure you have the correct browser driver installed (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome) and accessible in your system PATH.

Download `chromedriver.exe` manually from:
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
and place it in the `drivers/` folder.
